# J10c's Site

My site, consisting of posts. It also the airport for all of my creative services.

## Subscription

See the post subscription in `/zh-cn/blog/rss.xml`, up to now it only supports `zh-cn` posts subscription. Maybe you can see the link for `en` in future.

## Something nice

- A compact but elegant layout, some inspired from [Butterickâ€™s Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com).
- A delicate theme consists of colors red, gray, and green(sounds like something Christmas?).
- Fine font family appearance in title, link and code block.
- i18n support for Chinese(prefer) and English in UI, also multi languages in some posts.
- Using vim mode for scrolling in post view. I tried to design a full keyboard event mechanism for vim mode.

## Plans

Some creative things will be added to the site gradually, these are part of the plan.

- [ ] Emoji shortcut input, `:cry` -> ðŸ˜­,  in Markdown.
- [ ] Dynamic content, like what project I am doing, from server side(React SSR module).
- [ ] A UnoCSS refactor for site style.
